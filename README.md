Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a companyâ€™s customer base into distinct groups of individuals that share similar characteristics. These characteristics can be based on demographics, behaviors, purchasing patterns, needs, or preferences. The goal of segmentation is to enable businesses to tailor their marketing strategies, products, and services to better meet the specific needs of each customer group, leading to more effective communication, higher customer satisfaction, and increased business efficiency.
